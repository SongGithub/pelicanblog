:summary: Motivation to build project 'Djangology'

Recently when reading a site named 'todoMVC' which is a MVC framework comparision site, I came across the site author Addy OSMANI. Digged a little deeper, I found his Github, blog and current projects. His motto is quite admired by me: 'First DO it, then do it better'.

Therefore I think it is a good idea to improve the todolist project with whole new bunch of the latest technologies. Thinking of these, a new project is on the way.

Following same naming convention, I named it after the third album from Jean'Django' Reinhardt which is 'Djangology'
