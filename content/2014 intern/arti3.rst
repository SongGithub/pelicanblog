:summary: On how to land an IT job quickly

I came across this [blog] on IT job seeking and got inspired.

I summarise points as follows:
==============================

Identify your learning methods
--------------------------------
- List books and codes you've read. The list identify your passion in the field at least.
- Have account on the StackOverflow, projects on the Github
- Have own site
- Read blogs
- Find role models in the direction you after.


State facts, no vague descriptors
---------------------------------
Exact amount of projects done speak louder than adjectives like 'Strong skills in xxx, solid knowledge about yyy'.

Your work
---------
As said above, actual work prove what skills you really master. It is COOL to post a 2D bar code of my websites' URL on resume

Tricks on resume
----------------
