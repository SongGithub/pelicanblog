CSS fix
=======
Fixed scattered styling commands, and organised them into single style.css file which is referred in base html page. By loose-coupling styling instructions from html, I can make source code neater, and bring in ease of maintenance for later cycles of the app. Also, it fits into common practice in the industry better.

Integration of Bootstrap
========================
I can't emphasise more on how important a user-friendly interface is. So instead of just implementing back end work and leaving it ugly, I integrated Bootstrap, which serves as a cosmetic improvement into it.
Besides leaning how to put common Bootstrap components into the form like buttons, nav-bar, drop down menus and text area, I also found and installed toggle-switch and bootstrap3-datetimepicker so that boolean input and calender input can have visual effect close to what is on iPhone (iOS system).
