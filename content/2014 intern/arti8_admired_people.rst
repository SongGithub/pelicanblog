Roy. Fileding
=============
When trying gain understanding of REST framework, there is a key person I can't avoid. He is Roy who invented the RESTful framework in his thesis. The thesis then stood out from majority doctoral papers that were less influential to human IT infrastructure. I am very interested in how did he come up with such a invovative idea.

Addy Osmani
===========
He is a guru in JavaScript. I knew him through his 'todoMVC.com' when I studied JavaScript frameworks. Followed his link, I reached his Github repositories. What amazed me were the number of famous organisations he has worked for, and 6 thousand Github followers.

Reflection
----------
I am keen to know what make a great person in his field. And I am dreaming one day I can contribute to community and humanity.
