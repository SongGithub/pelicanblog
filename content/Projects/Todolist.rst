I was asked to practise what I've learnt. In particular, build a to do list app.

Technologies ultilised in the project are: Django, Django/views, Bootstrap/CSS, HTML, git(as version control tool), Heroku(as host), virtualenv.

As an initiative, I found Heroku in order to take my site online. However, it did take me some effort to understand how it work. Currently, the site is up-and-running with URL http://songs-todolist.herokuapp.com. Also, the source code is available in repository '2DoList'

To make it better, I am planning to add more desirable features in my own time, as a hobby. Features in mind now are:

- user account management/access control
- Media query/CSS3
- HTML5

It took me less than a week to finish, with kind assistance from coworker Frank and Moose.
