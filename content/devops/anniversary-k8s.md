Summary: 1 yr anniversary with k8s

I joined a company that builds its platform with Kubernetes last year this time.
I have since amazed how much this technology can help Developers and the Company!

## Its benefits:

### It saves time from developers to deploy

Developers do not need to worry about infrastructure running their workloads, as well
as alerting and monitoring. All they need to know now, is how to write simple
Kubernetes config yaml files with help from our team.


### It improves software development mentality

- Immutable infrastruture
- Immutable workload.
- Docker images as artifacts

Before, developers liked to maintain a long running machine which is special. Time
spent on manually configure them was an investment. So when something fails, the
person on call need to jump into the Server, spending time to resolve the problem.

Now, they don't need to and they can't do that anymore with Dockerised app running
on Kubernetes cluster.


## I have improved myself since then

There are people skills, tech skills, as well as table tennis skills gained in
 a large enterprise in Australia.

From technical perspective, I try to reduce my gap with some top-of-range
develoeprs I work with. In particular, is about to find root cause of a problem
with existing skills and knowledge.

From sports perspective, I do enjoy plays and a sense of craftmanship in
table tennis skills. That is, never stop to refine your skills in an area.
It is called Kaizen by Toyota people.
