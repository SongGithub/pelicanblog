Summary: how I build this blog

Back in time, I knew PelicanBlog was a Python module that can generate static
website for me, as well as GithubPages was a good place to host the static website
generated.

But the pain was I had to compile and update content manually, every and each time.

This time, I decide to automate this bit!
