Summary: 1 yr anniversary with k8s

I joined a company that build its platform with Kubernets last year this time.


## I have since amazed how much this technologies can help Developers and the company!


### It saves time from developers to deploy

Developers do not need to worry about infrasture running their workload, as well
as alerting and monitoring. All they need to know now, is how to write simple
Kubernetes config yaml files with help from our team's demo apps.


### It improves company development mentality

- Immutable infrastruture
- Immutable workload.
- Docker images as artifacts

## I have improved myself since then

There are people skills, tech skills, as well as tabel-tennis skills gained in
 a large enterprise in Australia.

From technical perspective, I try to reduce my gap with some top-of-range
develoeprs I work with. In particular, is about to find root cause of a problem
with existing skills and knowledge.

From sports perspective, I do enjoy plays and a sense of craftmanship in
table tennis skills. That is, never stop to refine your skills in an area.
It is called Kaizen by Toyota people.
