## Welcome to my blog!

I am Song, currently an intern back-end programmer at Tangent Snowball Australia, Southbank, Melbourne.

This blog is one of initiatives to improve my online visibility. As a self-marketing scheme, I would like to demonstrate my lastest technical achievements and what I learn recently at here.

Site improvements:
------------------
- 4-Mar-2014, splitted dev version and publishing version for the ease of developing
- 5-Mar-2014, added Google Analytics, enabling tracking of visit history. What a fun to be the god of my own site and enjoy these privileges of creation!
- 23-May-2018, It builds and publishes from Travis-CI
