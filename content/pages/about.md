Welcome to my blog!

I am Song Jin, currently a DevOps Engineer working in Melbourne. My focus is building a managed infrastructure platform with Kubernetes. The platform is:

  - Highly Availabile
  - Resilient
  - Multi-tenancy for internal teams

### Site improvements:

- 4-Mar-2014, splitted dev version and publishing version for the ease of developing
- 5-Mar-2014, added Google Analytics, enabling tracking of visit history. What a fun to be the god of my own site and enjoy these privileges of creation!
- 23-May-2018, It builds and publishes from Travis-CI
