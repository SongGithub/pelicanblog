:summary: how I start the internship

Gday!

There is a deadlock in tight IT job martket: As a fresh graduate you need experience to be considered for a position, but you can't get commercial experience unless you get a job.

Fortunately I was inspired by my girlfriend L that a better way to break the deadlock is to be an intern.

So I join the Tangent Snowball Australia as an intern.
