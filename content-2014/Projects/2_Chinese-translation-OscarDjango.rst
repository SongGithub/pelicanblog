:summary: My contribution to Oscar, an open source platform in Django

I am glad to have my contribution integrated into the Oscar, which is an open source platform in Django developed by Tangent for building eCommerce website swiftly.

On 4 Mar, 2014, Moose wanted me to translate Oscar into Chinese so that the platform can be available for Chinese stakeholders(especially for end-users).

I joined Transifex.com for the project, which has 1,900 keyword to workon, and 40% translation done. I started out reviewing 700 existing translations, fixed a few inapproiate translations. Then carried on translation for the un-translated.

Challeges are more from technical side rather than language side. The translation for software project does require in-depth understanding toward structure and functionality. Especially for Chinese which is a context-related language, one can't make sense from a word without reference to context around the word. Therefore, translator has to be technical enough to read code and understand things under the hood. As a result, most of my time in the project are spent on analysing source code or discussing with coworkers who have been working on Oscar. 

Therefore, besides translation, I will gain more technical understanding about Oscar/Django.
